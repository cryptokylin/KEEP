## token kind contract interface standard

### 1. open source
Token contracts must be open source, if third-party libraries are used, their source code of the corresponding version must be provided with your contract's source code.

### 2. `asset` data struct
  - In token contracts, you must use `asset` data structure which defined in [asset.hpp](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosiolib/asset.hpp) to represent user's token. you can't use your custom defined data structure to represent user's token, because this leads to a lot of incompatibility.  
  - symbol name must be uppercase english letters, and should not be longer than 7 characters.
  
### 2. actions
Token contracts must contain below actions and corresponding parameters:  

  - transfer  
    All assets related to the transfer must be checkable on the chain, such as asset transfer, transaction fee costs, etc.
    ``` 
    void transfer( account_name from,
                   account_name to,
                   asset        quantity,
                   string       memo );
    ```

### 3. tables
token contracts must contain below tables, 
and each table must contain at least the corresponding fields and use the same primary_key() listed blow.

   - the table name of `struct account` must be **accounts** , such as defined in [eosio.token.hpp](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.hpp#L54)  
   - table `accounts`'s code must be `_self` and scope must be the token balance `owner`, such as defined in [eosio.token.cpp](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.cpp#L88)  
   - the table name of `struct currency_stats` must be **stat**, such as defined in [eosio.token.hpp](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.hpp#L55)  
   - table `stat`'s code must be `_self` and scope must be the token symbol name `sym`, such as defined in [eosio.token.cpp](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.cpp#L20)  
  
  table structs
  ``` 
  struct account {
      asset    balance;

      uint64_t primary_key()const { return balance.symbol.name(); }
  };

  struct currency_stats {
      asset          supply;
      asset          max_supply;
      account_name   issuer;

      uint64_t primary_key()const { return supply.symbol.name(); }
  };

  ```
### 4. send inline action for various fees
It is very important that any transaction detail should be queryable on the chain. so if you charge for some operations, such as transaction fee for actiion `transfer`, then you need to send a separate action (such as SEND_INLINE_ACTION) for the feeï¼Œonly in this way can the transaction details be querying on the chain.

### 5. advice
It's better that token contracts be independent of business logic contracts. when a business logic contract need token operation, it should send action to token contract's abi interface to transfer token.
